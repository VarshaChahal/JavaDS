When to use BFS vs DFS:
TimeComplexity for both is same
BFS:
    queue stores a lot of data in memory when the tree is wide, or big and full

DFS:
    array stores a lot of data in memory when the tree is too deep


DFS on BST:
    InOrder will give the data in sorted manner
    PreOrder will give you the root immediately, you can flatten and reconstruct the tree from it.
